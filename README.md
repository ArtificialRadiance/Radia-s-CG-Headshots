# Radia's ClanGen Headshots
A ClanGen resprite mod that changes the cats into headshots.
---
Hello! This is a resprite project I wanted to make for a long time, and is fairly different from other projects. This is a complete resprite mod that changes you cats to pixelated head sprites rather than a full body.

## Displaying the Body
Due to this being for headshots, certain things cannot be displayed (hence why I don't recommend playing with this full time). These include body scars, body markings, and paralysis.
- Paralyzed cats will have 🔴 in an upper corner to indicate their paralysis.
- Cats that are sick will have a custom sprite and an ❗ above their heads
- Cats that have missing limbs will have a circle in one of the lower corners.
   - Missing paw = 🔵
   - Missing Tail = 🟡 // Half Tail = 🟡 halved
-# I have not decided if I plan on noting white markings that only cover the body yet, whether its through another symbol or by adding something like a spot to the face; might make a poll about it.
